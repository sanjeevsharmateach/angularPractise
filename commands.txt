the loading starts from root component which is present in index.html page ususallay <root-app> than it goes to app.component.ts where we have selector @Component({
  selector: 'app-root'
  
  all app related info goes in app component and there selectors are added in app
  
  Steps to create components
  
1)import { Component } from "@angular/core";---> importing only component part from angular core lib
@Component({selector:'app-server', --> @ component to tell its special type script class and selector for giving name to html tag using which it will be idintified tempurl for import html
templateUrl:'./server.component.html'

})
export class ServerComponent{ ---> normal typescript class

}

2) in appmodule.ts file add ur component typerscript class to so that agular identfies it
declarations: [
    ServerComponent,
    AppComponent
  ],
and than import it like this import { ServerComponent } from './server/server.component';
* ng g c --> ng generate component <component name> to generate ccomponent using cli
